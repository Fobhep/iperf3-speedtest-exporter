# Speedtest Exporter

Simple "Speedtest" **exporter** for **Prometheus** written in **Python** using iperf3.
This solution is significantly inspired by https://github.com/MiguelNdeCarvalho/speedtest-exporter.

I wrote this since the Ookla speedtest CLI tool was broken and I needed a replacement.

Please keep in mind this repository is not what you would normally use to run a speed test from your ISP or find on websites.
If you are interested in something like that rather consider using the original repository.
